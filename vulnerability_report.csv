ID,Vulnerability Name,Description,Severity,CVSS Score
1,SQL Injection,"This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data manipulation.",High,9.8
2,Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),"This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, which can result in data theft and session hijacking.",Medium,6.5
3,Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR),"This issue allows attackers to access unauthorized data by manipulating references to objects, such as database entries or files, through a user input.",High,8.6
4,Outdated Software,"Running outdated software versions exposes the system to known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer releases, increasing the risk of exploitation.",Low,4.3
5,Buffer Overflow,"This vulnerability occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system crashes.",High,9.0
6,Weak Encryption,"Utilizing outdated or weak encryption algorithms can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data, making it easier for attackers to decrypt.",Medium,6.0
7,Unpatched Vulnerability,"Failing to apply security patches leaves the system susceptible to exploits targeting known vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of a successful attack.",High,8.7
8,Default Credentials,"Using default credentials provides an easy entry point for attackers, as these are often well-known and can be used to gain unauthorized access to systems.",Critical,10.0
9,Open Redirect,"An open redirect allows attackers to redirect users to malicious sites, potentially leading to phishing attacks and other security risks.",Medium,6.3
10,Clickjacking,"This issue occurs when a malicious site embeds a legitimate site in a hidden frame, tricking users into performing unintended actions on the legitimate site.",Medium,6.1
11,Privilege Escalation,"This vulnerability allows attackers to gain higher privileges than intended, potentially leading to full control over the system and its resources.",High,8.4
12,Information Disclosure,Sensitive information leakage through error messages or misconfigurations can provide attackers with valuable data for further attacks.,Low,4.5
13,Denial of Service (DoS),"DoS vulnerabilities can be exploited to exhaust system resources, rendering the service unavailable to legitimate users.",Critical,9.5
14,Unencrypted Communications,Transmitting sensitive data over unencrypted channels exposes it to interception and unauthorized access.,High,8.2
15,Security Misconfiguration,Incorrect security settings in software or hardware configurations can lead to vulnerabilities that are easily exploitable by attackers.,Medium,6.0
16,Improper Session Management,"Failing to properly manage session IDs can result in session hijacking, where attackers can impersonate legitimate users.",High,8.0
17,Insufficient Logging and Monitoring,Lack of comprehensive logging and monitoring can delay the detection and response to security incidents.,Medium,6.4
18,Insecure Deserialization,"Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code on the server.",Critical,9.8
19,Weak Password Policy,Allowing weak passwords increases the likelihood of unauthorized access due to password guessing or brute force attacks.,Medium,5.0
20,Missing Security Headers,"Missing security headers in HTTP responses can weaken the security posture, making the application more vulnerable to attacks like clickjacking and XSS.",Low,4.2
21,Insufficient Authentication,Weak authentication mechanisms in APIs can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.,High,8.3
22,Hardcoded Credentials,"Storing credentials in source code poses a significant risk if the code is exposed, allowing attackers easy access to sensitive systems.",Critical,10.0
23,Security Policy Violation,Violating organizational security policies can result in non-compliance and increased risk of security incidents.,Medium,5.5
24,Remote Code Execution (RCE),"This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control over the system.",Critical,9.9
25,Unauthorized Access,Insufficient access controls can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to administrative functions and sensitive data.,High,8.8
